bunch of tasks, didn't figured out second and third one
part 1: <br />
didn't translate it, just some simple styling but not sure if I did it right way, also I didn't comment CSS code

part 2: <br />
-- Create a query that will produce a result in the form of a table (not row!) <br />
-- Of 12 rows, each row has 2 columns, where first column contains month of the current year, and second one number of days in said month. <br />
-- Do not use any existing tables from the database in the query, including temporary ones, i.e. the query should work immediately from any SQL console.

part 3: <br />
Write your own short implementation of $ (function () {}) for window.onload.
