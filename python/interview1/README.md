Simple REST API made on flask with two endpoints I did for interview

got hired and fired not long after because wasn't expirienced enough and company had tough deadlines to meet

accepts txt file into POST and scans it's contents, returns file's contents on GET

Простой рест на фласке, принимает в POST txt файл и сохраняет текст из него в бд, возвращает данные в GET

pip install -r requirements.txt

flask run

flask db init

flask db migrate

flask db upgrade
